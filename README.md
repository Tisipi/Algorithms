# Algorithms
Some basic well-known algorithms. Most of them are not really computer science algorithms, but rather little programs that are handled in Coding Interview books and courses.

Algorithms are written in Python using Test Driven Development. Every algorithm has a source file and a unit test file.

Algorithm | Description
--------- | -----------
reverse_string  |   Reverses a string. Miscellaneous solutions.
palindrome  |   Checks whether a string is a palindrome.
reverse_integer |   Reverses an integer.
max_char    |   Calculates most occurring character in a string.
character_frequency |   Similar to max_char above, but using Class that creates frequency of characters.
